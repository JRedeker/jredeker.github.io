## A New Blog

Here she is!  My first blog post on the new site.

Looking forward to jotting down my thoughts and lessons learned from the projects I do.  I plan to use this blog mainly for myself, as a way to remember and enforce the things I learn - I don't always have the best memory.

I'll probably also post opinion pieces on my wide variety of interests, with the full expectation of zero readers and an occasional bot posting an exlplicit comment I'll need to remove.

My goals for this site and blog are really just to further understand what is needed for me to start creating these for friends and family - in a sustainable way that allows them to post with ease!

If you enjoy my work - thanks!  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help with your projects.

Hasta luego,
Jon
